  Edit History is a powerful undo/redo feature that automatically tracks all changes made to your subtitle project. Think of it as a complete timeline that lets you review and go back to any point in your editing journey.
  
  Key Concepts:
  • Changes are automatically tracked as you edit
  • Each entry stores the exact state of affected subtitle lines
  • You can go back to any previous point with a single tap
  • History is preserved when you save your project
  • Two types: Regular changes (track specific edits) and Full Backups (complete state)
  
  Benefits:
  • Undo any mistake, even after saving
  • Review your editing timeline
  • Restore previous versions of specific lines
  • Experiment freely knowing you can always go back
  • Compare different versions side by side

            content: '''
  The Audio Waveform is a powerful visual tool that displays the audio amplitude of your video as a graphical representation. This feature helps you create perfectly timed subtitles by showing you exactly when dialogue, sound effects, or music occurs in the audio track.
  
  Benefits:
  • See audio patterns visually - identify speech, silence, and sound effects
  • Create precise subtitle timing based on actual audio
  • Detect scene changes and dialogue breaks
  • Work more efficiently without constant video playback
  • Identify where subtitles should start and end
  • Spot timing errors at a glance
  • Professional-grade editing capability
  
  The waveform appears as a horizontal bar below or within your subtitle timeline, showing peaks (loud audio) and valleys (quiet audio or silence).

            content: '''
  The first time you enable the waveform for a video, the app needs to extract and process the audio data. This is a one-time process that creates a cached representation for future use.
  
  Generation Process:
  • Audio is extracted from your video file
  • Waveform data is calculated and optimized
  • Multiple zoom levels are pre-generated
  • Data is cached for instant loading next time
  • Progress is shown during generation
  
  Time Required:
  • Depends on video length and device performance
  • Typical 2-hour movie: 1-3 minutes on mobile, faster on desktop
  • The app remains responsive during generation
  • You can continue other work while it processes
  • Generated waveform is saved permanently
  
  Multi-Track Audio Support:
  • If video has multiple audio tracks (languages, commentary, etc.)
  • The waveform uses your selected audio track from video player
  • Change audio track and regenerate to see different track's waveform
  • Useful for multi-language subtitling projects

  • High peaks: Loud dialogue, music, or sound effects
  • Flat/low areas: Silence or very quiet background noise
  • Consistent patterns: Continuous speech
  • Sudden spikes: Sound effects, scene changes
  • Gaps between patterns: Natural pauses in dialogue
  • Rhythmic patterns: Music or repetitive sounds
  
  Using Audio Visual Cues:
  • Start subtitles just before dialogue peaks begin
  • End subtitles when dialogue peaks end
  • Use silence gaps to split long dialogues
  • Align subtitles with natural speech patterns
  • Avoid placing subtitles during pure silence

  Use the waveform to create professional, precisely-timed subtitles that sync perfectly with dialogue.
  
  Timing Strategy:
  • Look for dialogue peaks in the waveform
  • Start subtitle just before peak begins (0.1-0.2s early)
  • End subtitle when peak ends or next dialogue starts
  • Leave small gaps between subtitles for readability
  • Align with natural speech rhythm visible in waveform
  
  Best Practices:
  • Zoom in for precise timing of individual lines
  • Use waveform to detect overlapping subtitles
  • Look for silence gaps to split long dialogues
  • Match subtitle length to speech duration
  • Start/end subtitles at audio peaks, not in silence
  • Use consistent timing patterns throughout movie
  
  Common Timing Scenarios:
  • Continuous dialogue: Minimal gap between subtitles
  • Questions and answers: Small gap for breath/pause
  • Scene changes: Larger gap, visible in waveform
  • Background music: Waveform shows music vs dialogue
  • Overlapping speech: Multiple audio peaks visible
  • Whispers: Low amplitude peaks, zoom vertically to see

  • Cache automatically managed by the app

  Regeneration:

  Videos often contain multiple audio tracks (different languages, commentary, audio descriptions). The waveform can be generated from any audio track you select.
  
  How Multi-Track Works:
  • Video player detects all available audio tracks
  • Select your preferred track via video player controls
  • Waveform automatically uses your selected track
  • Selection is saved with your project
  • Regenerate waveform if you switch audio tracks
  
  Common Use Cases:
  • Multi-language movies: Generate waveform for your target language
  • Director's commentary: Use original audio track, not commentary
  • Audio descriptions: Select main audio, not description track
  • Dual audio anime: Choose Japanese or English track
  • Multiple mix versions: Select the correct audio mix
  
  Track Selection:
  • Audio track selection done in video player
  • Look for audio/track icon in video controls
  • Selected track is remembered per project
  • Waveform uses saved track automatically
  • Change track and regenerate for different waveform

            content: '''
  MSone is a group that began its journey on October 28, 2012, with the mission of creating subtitles for foreign language films. The name "MSone" stands for "Malayalam Subtitles for Everyone."
  
  This initiative empowers cinema enthusiasts who encounter language barriers to fully immerse themselves in films by easily downloading and utilizing subtitles from MSone. We started by offering subtitles for classic English films, and as our popularity grew, we gradually expanded to include subtitles for Indian language films beyond Malayalam. Today, we are proud to provide subtitles for Tamil films as well.
  
  As MSone celebrates over 12 years of its journey, we take pride in having shaped the cinematic experiences of Malayali movie lovers. We grew out of our love for cinema, without expecting any material rewards from the services we provide. Our strength lies in our Facebook group, which boasts over 1,50,000 members, along with tens of thousands of others who enjoy films with MSone subtitles sourced from our website and various platforms.
  
  Film societies across Kerala use subtitles from MSone for film screenings and popularise our group. This enables us to reach all strata of society, eliminating language as a barrier to enjoying cinema. We are proud to be a part of this endeavor.
